# Project constraints

- Phase 1 only until the user explicitly expands scope. Do not change gameplay/campaign.
- Never write to game installation or Workshop paths. Reference packs are read-only inputs.
- Do not install/update software or schemas without user permission.
- All extraction goes to ignored `reference/local/`. Never bundle or commit third-party assets.
- Only authored source may enter `src/`. Keep source, reference, build, and dist separate.
- Use verified paths in ignored `config/local.json`; do not guess tool commands or Lua APIs.
- Any future runtime claim must distinguish static startpos, frontend placeholders, MCT options, and a live save.
- Re-check dependency hashes after Steam updates. Validate schema before importing changed DB tables.
- No publishing or gameplay launch is part of Phase 1.
